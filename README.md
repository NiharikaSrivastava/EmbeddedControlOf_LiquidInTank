Developed an ultrasonic based non-contacting type liquid level sensing program and control for industries and home use. Non contacting ultrasonic sensors are connected with an Arduino UNO board to provide the intelligence for measuring the liquid level in a tank/reservoir and its automatic filling is ensured if the level falls below a certain predefined level.
